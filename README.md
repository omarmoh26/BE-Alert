# BE-Alert
Driving is one of the activities that require concentration in daily life. Many road crashes are claimed
to have a driver’s exhaustion, drowsiness, inattention, or distraction as a major contributing factor. An
electroencephalogram (EEG) is the recording of brain electrical activity using electrodes that are placed
on the scalp. Classification of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is one of the effective methods
used in detecting drowsiness. This project aims to alert drowsy drivers using a brain-computer interface,
which consists of a brain sensor and a mobile interface. At First, the acquired brain signals by the sensor
will go through multiple phases, which consist of feature extraction and classification using learning
based algorithms. Then, the result will be converted into visual and audio feedback using a mobile
application to alert the drowsy driver to save himself and save other people’s lives.
